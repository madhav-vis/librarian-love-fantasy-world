      "text": "The narrator had just turned six years old and had a wonderful day with friends, a party, and gifts, which they didn't want to end, leading them to covertly reset all the clocks in the house.",
      "isCorrect": true,
      "feedback": "The passage states, \"on night 2,193, the night I turned six years old—I discovered direct action,\" and \"I had just had one of the best days of my young life, complete with friends, a party, and even gifts, and I wasn’t about to let it end... So I went about covertly resetting all the clocks in the house.\" This directly matches the information provided."

      "text": "The narrator was tired of their parents sending them to bed before their sister, so they convinced their sister to help them reset the clocks in the house.",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "While the narrator felt it was unfair to go to sleep before their sister, the passage does not state that the sister was involved in resetting the clocks. The narrator acted alone and covertly."

      "text": "The \"authorities\" failed to notice the narrator's crying and begging for reform, prompting the narrator to loudly announce they were the master of time and refuse to sleep.",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "The passage mentions that the authorities weren't interested in calls for reform (crying, begging). However, the direct action involved covertly resetting clocks, not a loud announcement. The feeling of being 'master of time' came after the clocks were reset and unnoticed."

    {
      "text": "The narrator wanted to experience the summer solstice in June and decided to stay awake all night to see the sunrise by disabling the household clocks.",
      "isCorrect": false,
      "feedback": "The passage states the narrator fell asleep on the floor and 'finally seen the sunset on June 21, the summer solstice,' but the motivation for the direct action was to extend a good day, not specifically to experience the solstice or see the sunrise. The action was resetting clocks, not disabling them."

  "summary": "The passage describes the narrator's first 'hack,' which occurred on their sixth birthday when they covertly reset all the household clocks to extend a wonderful day and avoid bedtime, resulting in them feeling like the 'master of time' before eventually falling asleep on the floor."
